    "Numerical superstitious beliefs are wide spread in Asian countries and have a powerful impact in decision-making, from choosing a license plate or mobile number to making momentous decisions, such as buying a house. People who have been immersed in Asian culture tend to believe that things associated with the \"lucky numbers\" can also bring them good luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example eight is considered the luckiest number because it sounds like \"wealth\" in Chinese. Four, on the other side, is often deemed as an inauspicious number because it sounds like the Chinese word for death. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the surge of Chinese buyers in the U.S. housing market, properties related to auspicious numbers might be more appealing to buyers, and vice versa. I want to examine the U.S. housing data to see whether the street number or the apartment number could affect the property values. My hypothesis is that in markets with more ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese buyers, average price of houses with street addresses ending or starting with the unlucky number four will be lower while that with the lucky number eight will be higher.\n",
